Notes and random things we want/have to do.
Please put your name to it if you are working on it.
----------------------------------------------------------


* starmap/universe data structure, which will act as a AI’s statefull source of info, add method which will merge and update the starfield from actual state
* GameClient implementation which takes care of all the universe/player updated (e.g. if you buy a fleer, increase number of fleets, credit the money, etc. )
* Improve logging and make replay mechanism with dummy GameClient, so we can debug.
* Shortest(quickest) path matrix - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm (shortest or quickest? Difference: takes in account gateways)
* to supply first line(s) effectively we can consider something like this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree
* usage of influence maps ? http://gameschoolgems.blogspot.co.nz/2009/12/influence-maps-i.html
